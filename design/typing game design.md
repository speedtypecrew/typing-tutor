# Game Design:

- Have user fill in 'ghost text' of the practice sentences. Use color to differentiate between correct and incorrect inputs.
- Stop the user from using spacebar before min chars of words are typed?
- Option to require fully correct word before advancing
- Option to require backspaces to correct errors
-
